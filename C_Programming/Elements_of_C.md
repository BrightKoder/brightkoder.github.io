## Elements of C
Like any other programming language, C also have few basic building blocks which are used to write the C programs.

Elements like Character set, Keywords or Reserved words, Operators and Variables etc called as the Building blocks of any programming language.

These foundational elements, Which we can use to create our application logic.

Here is the List of Elements of C language.

1. Character set in C
2. Identifiers & Rules to Defining Identifiers
3. Keywords
4. Comments
5. Constants
6. Variables
7. Operators
8. Datatypes
9. Statements

Let's discuss above elements in-detail

### 1. Character Set in C Language
The `C Language` have basic character set which includes the `Alphabets`, `Digits`, `Special Characters`, and `Escape Sequences`, etc.

So Lets discuss above them one by one.

#### Alphabets:
C-Programming language support all the 52 upper and lower case characters of Alphabets.

Here are the list of alphabets

##### Upper-case alphabets:
```c
A,B,C,D..............Z 
```
##### Lower-case Alphabets:
```c

```
##### Digits:
The ten decimal digits starting from zero upto the 9.
```c
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```
##### Special Characters:
The C Programming Language supports 29 special characters like brackets (Curly brackets, Square brackets), Quotes, Hash, Question mark and so on. C language support most of the popular special characters List of Special Characters in C Language:

Here are the list of special characters in C
 
```
 !  "  #  &  '  (  )  *  %  +  ,  -  /  . ;  :  <  =  >  ?  [ ^  ]  -  _  {  }  |  ~
 ```

##### White Space characters
C Language also supports five White Space characters.

1. Space
2. Horizontal tab
3. Vertical tab
4. Newline
5. Form feed 

##### Escape Sequences

An escape sequence in C language is a sequence of characters that doesn't represent itself when used inside string literal or character.

It is composed of two or more characters starting with backslash \. For example: \n represents new line.

**List of Escape Sequences**

| Escape Sequence  | Meaning                |
| -----------------|:----------------------:|
| \a               | Alarm or Beep          |
| \b               | Backspace              |
| \f               | Form feed              |
| \n               | New line               |
| \r	              | Carriage Return        |
| \t	              | Tab (Horizontal)       |
| \v               | Vertical Tab           |
| \\	              | Backslash              |
| \'	              | Single Quote           |
| \"	              | Double Quote           |
| \?	              | Question Mark          |
| \nnn	            | octal number           |
| \xhh	            | hexadecimal number     |
| \0	              | Null                   |
