# Elements of C
This section describes the elements of the C programming language, including the names, numbers, and characters used to construct a C program. The ANSI C syntax labels
these components tokens.

This section explains how to define tokens and how the compiler evaluates them.

The following topics are discussed:
* Tokens
* Comments
* Keywords
* Identifiers
* Constants
* String literals

Punctuation and special characters

Operators are symbols (both single characters and character combinations) that specify how values are to be manipulated. Each symbol is interpreted as a single unit,
called a token
